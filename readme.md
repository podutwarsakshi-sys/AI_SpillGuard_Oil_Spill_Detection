# AI SpillGuard – Oil Spill Detection System

## Project Overview
AI SpillGuard is a deep learning–based system for detecting and segmenting
oil spill regions from satellite images. The project was developed as an
internship project and implemented in four milestones.

## Milestones
- Milestone 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Milestone 2: Model Architecture Design
- Milestone 3: Training & Evaluation
- Milestone 4: Deployment using Streamlit

## Final Output
The final system (Milestone 4) provides a Streamlit-based web application
to upload satellite images and visualize oil spill detection results
in real time.

## How to Run (Milestone 4)
```bash
cd Milestone_4_Deployment
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
